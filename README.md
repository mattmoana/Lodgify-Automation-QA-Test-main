To run from terminal is used: npm run cy:run --browser chrome. Sometimes npm run cy:run did not run for me. 
Pricing tests I tested using prod https://www.lodgify.com/pricing. There were few bugs with price display and currency display if tested local.
Contacts - did not finish, could not set the date correctly, found the solution, but did not work, and ran out of time. If required will do it, but need more time. There also was bug - no error message if phone field was empty.

Added bug reports in the same file as manual task.
